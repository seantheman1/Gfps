## Overview

[A simple fps monitor for garry's mod]
 
This addon is designed to monitor (frames per second) in game. It provides detailed statistics, including Average FPS, Minimum FPS, Frametime, 1% lows, 5% lows and graphical representations to track the performance over time.

## Features

### Key Features:
- **FPS** Display the current fps.
- **Average FPS**: Displays the average FPS over a period of time.
- **Minimum FPS**: Tracks and displays the lowest FPS observed.
- **1% Low**:  This represents the FPS value that is lower than 99% of all frame times observed. It’s the value where the bottom 1% of FPS readings are discarded, showing the worst FPS you experience 1% of the time.
- **5% Low**: Similar to the 1% low, but it represents the FPS where 95% of frames are higher, and the bottom 5% are discarded.
- **Frametime**: This is the time (in milliseconds) each frame takes to render. It’s typically calculated by measuring the difference in time between two consecutive frames.
- **FPS Graph**: Visual representation of FPS performance over time, allowing you to spot dips and trends.

Shows the current fps. This metric helps with knowing current peformance.

#### Average FPS:

The graph above shows the average FPS throughout the testing period. This metric helps show overall performance.

#### Minimum FPS:
The minimum FPS graph shows the lowest frame rates observed, which can help identify any performance drops that affect gameplay.

##### 1% Low: 
Shows the FPS value that is lower than 99% of all frame times observed. 1% of the fps you experience at one time.

#### 5% Low:
Show 1% low, represents the FPS where 95% of frames are higher.

#### Frametime:
Shows the time (in milliseconds) each frame takes to render.

#### FPS Graph: 
This graph plots the FPS over time, giving users a visual representation of performance fluctuations.
